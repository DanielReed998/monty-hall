# monty-hall

basic description of Monty-Hall problem:

  Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, "Do you want to pick door No. 2?" Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?
  
the results.txt file shows that switching to the other door does indeed have a 2/3 chance of winning the car, as opposed to a 1/3 chance when sticking with the original door. This works with any door the contestant might choose.
